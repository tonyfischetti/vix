// css, flexbox, align-self, alignment, flex-end

/*
 * This allows the default alignment to be overridden
 * for an individual flex item
 **/

#example {
    align-self: flex-end;
}

/**
 * Possible values:
 *
 * stretch (default): stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)
 * flex-start / start / self-start: items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction rules or the writing-mode rules.
 * flex-end / end / self-end: items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting flex-direction rules vs. writing-mode rules.
 * center: items are centered in the cross-axis
 * baseline: items are aligned such as their baselines align
