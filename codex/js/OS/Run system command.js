 *
 *  --- ASYNCHRONOUS --------------------------------------
 * 
 *   child_process.exec(command[, options][, callback])
 * Spawns a shell then executes the command within that shell, buffering
 * any generated output. The command string passed to the exec function is
 * processed directly by the shell and special characters (vary based on
 * shell) need to be dealt with accordingly....
 * Instead of, for example ("ls", ["-al"]) {like in `spawn`}
 * you use the whole string: "ls -al"
 * It takes a callback with the following three args (error, stdout, stderr)
 *
 *   child_process.execFile(file[, args][, options][, callback])
 * The child_process.execFile() function is similar to child_process.exec()
 * except that it does not spawn a shell by default. Rather, the specified
 * executable file is spawned directly as a new process making it slightly
 * more efficient than child_process.exec().
 * 
 *   child_process.fork()
 * The child_process.fork() method is a special case of child_process.spawn()
 * used specifically to spawn new Node.js processes. Like
 * child_process.spawn(), a ChildProcess object is returned. The returned
 * ChildProcess will have an additional communication channel built-in that
 * allows messages to be passed back and forth between the parent and child.
 * See subprocess.send() for details.
 *
 *  --- SYNCHRONOUS --------------------------------------
 *
 *   child_process.spawnSync(command[, args][, options])
 * The child_process.spawnSync() method is generally identical to
 * child_process.spawn() with the exception that the function will not
 * return until the child process has fully closed. When a timeout has been
 * encountered and killSignal is sent, the method won't return until the
 * process has completely exited. If the process intercepts and handles the
 * SIGTERM signal and doesn't exit, the parent process will wait until the
 * child process has exited.
 * It returns an object with the following properties...
 *   {pid, output (array), stdout, stderr, status (exit code), signal, error}
 *
 * AND SO ON...
