  I did some computer-y stuff to construct a personal Spanish text corpus and
  create a Spanish verb study guide specifically tailored to the linguistic
  variety of Spanish I intend to consume and produce. It worked fairly well. It
  also revealed a (in some small way) generalizable depiction of the relative
  frequencies of Spanish verb tenses and moods. This technique may prove to be
  extremely beneficial to Spanish-language pedagogy. If you’re uninterested in my
  motivations or procedure, you can skip to the section labeled “results”.

  As regular readers of this blog may be aware, one of my favorite activities is
  marshaling the skills that I use as a computational scientist to study the
  humanities. For example, in a previous post, we saw how principles from
  phylogenetic systematics helped textual critics reconstruct the original
  manuscript for “The Canterbury Tales”; in another, we deployed techniques first
  used to study physics to the end of fooling vineyards into retweeting fake,
  computer-generated wine reviews.

  For this post, I used both tools from computational linguistics and some
  good-old-fashioned data wrangling (web-scraping, parsing texts, etc…) to create
  a custom-fit Spanish verb study guide.
